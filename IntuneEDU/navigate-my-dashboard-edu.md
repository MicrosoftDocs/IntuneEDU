# Navigate your dashboard

Your _dashboard_ is the main landing page for Intune for Education. It's where you begin every time you sign in, and it's the starting point to manage your users, apps, and devices.

## Dashboard defaults and customizations  
The default dashboard shows the following tiles to help get you started with essential device management tasks:

* Launch Express Configuration
* School Data Sync
* Manage user and device groups
* Manage apps

Some tiles, such as School Data Sync and Manage apps, show metrics like configuration status and current app inventory.

You can use the dashboard tools to expand, edit, download, clone, or delete your dashboard.

Select **New dashboard** to create a dashboard from scratch. Creating a new dashboard doesn't overwrite or remove existing dashboards. Select the arrow next to the current dashboard name to access your other dashboards.

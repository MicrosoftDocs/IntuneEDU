# Windows 10 device settings in Intune for Education

This article lists and describes all Windows device settings in Intune for Education. To view and edit these settings in the portal, click **Groups** > **Settings** > **Windows Device Settings**.  


  ![Screenshot of the All Devices, Groups page in Intune for Education. Highlights the Settings tab and shows the Windows Device Settings category is expanded to show all 10 subcategories of settings. Each setting is collapsed.](./media/edu-windows-device-settings-1812.png)   

## Apply settings  
Apply [group settings](what-are-groups.md) to establish access and security boundaries on the devices in your school. You can assign the same settings across all groups in your school; or you can customize the classroom experience and apply settings to individual groups.  

## Configuration options  
Many settings in Intune for Education are configured to **Block** or **Allow**. For some settings, **Not configured** is an option. When toggled to **Not Configured**, the device will either:  
* Use the default setting. 
* Allow the device user (student or teacher) to customize the setting from their device.    

> [!NOTE]
> User, app, and device settings differ from [tenant settings](edu-tenant-general-settings.md). Tenant settings address the subscription and management settings for your organization.
